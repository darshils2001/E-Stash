# E-Stash
Digital Receipt Storing App created for the Dubhacks 2019 hackathon. 

This program leverages Google Cloud's Vision API to first identify if an image contains a reciept, and if so, the program stores various data (retailer name, expiration date, etc.) to the system for maintaining a digital receipt database.
